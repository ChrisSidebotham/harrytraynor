I find myself using emojis all the time and work and in my personal communications. Love or hate them, I think they add a level of communication that is visual and easier to understand than words. Even down to the simple 👍 to say thanks for something. Now if you know Teams, you have probably already discovered and used them in loads of different ways. However there is a quicker way to add them to messages - **short codes**!

To insert an emoji using short codes all you need to do is to put the emoji name into some brackets - below are some examples.

| Short Code &nbsp    | Emoji &nbsp	|
|--------------------	|-------	    |
| (yes)      	        | 👍     	    |
| (muscle)   	        | 💪     	    |
| (facepalm) 	        | 🤦‍    	     |
| (star)     	        | ⭐          |

Now you might be thinking how do I find my favourite emojis? Simply use the emoji selector, hover over one of them and it will display a tooltip with its name - this is what you put in the brackets.

Have Fun! 🥳

If you had to ask me how to sell Teams in a matter of seconds, what would I pick as my top features?
* People can't send you spam emails inside of Teams ðŸ¤Ÿ.
* Even if you send something you didn't mean to, you can edit or delete it afterwards.
* You can always see when someone is replying to your message with instant feedback.
* It's easy to use audio, visual and screen share instantly.
* Communications are automatically categorised into the Teams you work in. No more complex mail rules.

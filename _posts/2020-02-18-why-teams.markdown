If you had to ask me how to sell Teams in a matter of seconds, what would I pick as my top features?
* People can't send you spam emails inside of Teams ðŸ¤Ÿ.
* Even if you send something you didn't mean to, you can edit or delete it afterwards.
* You can always see when someone is replying to your message with instant feedback.
* It's easy to use audio, visual and screen share instantly.
* Communications are automatically categorised into the Teams you work in. No more complex mail rules.

## Think Modern
Challenge yourself and your organisation. Do you really need to send an email. You could just say this is another bit of tech. But if you think how little email has changed over a long time, shouldn't we be looking to improve the way we work?

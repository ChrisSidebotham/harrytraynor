I remember training sessions around using the online versions of the Office suite being interesting - they did not have enough functionality compared to the desktop versions and certainly put people off using them. Track changes was an extremely popular request, but thankfully has been implemented now! The online versions for me were always powerful and fit into my work style - also with the release of the simplified ribbon it became my go to for quick, distraction free editing.  

It seems however that the tables have turned. Word online now has a clever new tool that analyses what you write. You might be thinking this is just a “new lick of paint” for the spell check that has been a core of Word for a while. To put it simply – it is not.

The first thing you will see in the picture above is a new Editor pane in word. Word will analyse all these various categories of your writing and let you know if there anything you can do better or needs correcting. This alone is a lot more than a basic spell checker. 

To access this new pane, make sure you are using the online version, or you have the most up to date desktop app installed (it does work on desktop, but not all the features have been rolled out yet). Under the Home tab along the top ribbon you should see right at the end, a choice for Editor.  

At the bottom of the editor pane you will notice there are some stats about your document – readability and amount of time to speak for example. Writing communication documents or planning a script for a talk just got a lot easier.

Please do bear in mind that this is using the internet to analyse your document – hence the longer your document becomes the longer it will take to process all the data. So, the best advice here is to make sure you run it often and keep on top of updated content being added. 

If you do just want to cherry pick out different sentences, you can highlight a sentence you want rewording, rick click and choose Rewrite Suggestions - it will give you a few options of how you could rewrite the sentence and choose one if you like it.

Compared to what Word offered before, this is a significant improvement and has certainly helped me think about how I write! Run editor on something you have recently written and see what it thinks. Do bear in mind it is in preview.

I remember training sessions around using the online versions of the Office suite being interesting - they did not have enough functionality compared to the desktop versions and certainly put people off using them. Track changes was an extremely popular request, but thankfully has been implemented now! The online versions for me were always powerful and fit into my work style - also with the release of the simplified ribbon it became my go to for quick, distraction free editing. 

There is a new tool in preview now that caught my attention, which is one of those tools you take for granted - the spell checker. It has over the year developed and included more language correction / assist features to help you create the best documents - but with the most recent addition of the **Editor**, Word has just stepped it up a gear.

To access this new tool, make sure you are using the online version, or you have the most up to date desktop app installed. Under the **Home** tab along the top ribbon you should see right at the end, a choice for **Editor**.  

Compared to what Word offered before, this is a significant improvement and has certainly helped me think about how I write! Run it on documents you already have and see what improvements you could make. Do bear in mind it is **in preview**.
